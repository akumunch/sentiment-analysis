I'm starting with r/wallstreetbets to learn how PRAW and it's functions work. 
I learnt a lot of today. The best of it is learning how to read official documentation and properly apply it. 

First, i created my reddit instance, which includes generating client_id and a client_secret which are key to using PRAW. 
I'm taking reference from a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAfIvkyFjQ to make my start a lot smoother :)!
