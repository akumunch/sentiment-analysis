# sentiment-analysis
As i am writing this (on 03-08-2025), i'm a completely new to the world of ML, data scraping, etc. The entire point of this project is to enhance my skills, learn new and cool stuff, make myself comfortable with treading unknown waters, and make my resume (and github) a little cooler ;)!

I have planned to put in an hour everyday on this project. Taking it slow is the secret, as far as i have understood. 
I will be updating this repo whenever i put in my 1 hour of work, marking my days as day-1, day-2, and so on. Considering my hectic schedule, i will decide to take a day or two off, which will only increase my efficieny. 

I'll be trying out sentiment analysis using python. My goal is to create an ML model which predicts stock price movement using the same. This is a pretty common project in the world of computer science, and i'm taking this up for starting my ML/data-science journey :)!

For starters, i'll be working with PRAW (to analyse discussions in various subreddits like (r/) 'wallstreetbets', 'stocks', 'investing', 'IndianStockMarket', 'StockMarketIndia').
After figuring out how to scrape the data, and use it for my model, i will be moving on to scraping other social media platforms like YouTube, Telegram, etc. 
Post that, i could do news websites/aggregators and forums/blogs as well to collect as much data as possible and analyse how it affects the stock price movement.
